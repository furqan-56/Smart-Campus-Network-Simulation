## Overview
The Smart Campus Network Simulation is designed to showcase:
- Efficient network segmentation using VLANs.
- Seamless inter-VLAN communication.
- Integration of wired and wireless connectivity.
- Implementation of robust security measures.
- Configuration of essential servers (e.g., DHCP, DNS, Web).
- Introduction of IoT devices for modern campus management.

This project serves as a comprehensive example of a scalable and secure network infrastructure suitable for educational institutions.

## Features
1. **VLANs:**
   - Logical segmentation of campus departments.
   - Improved broadcast domain control.
2. **Inter-VLAN Routing:**
   - Ensures communication between different VLANs.
3. **Wireless Connectivity:**
   - Integration of access points for seamless mobile connectivity.
4. **Network Security:**
   - Use of access control lists (ACLs) to restrict unauthorized access.
   - Secure configuration of devices to prevent vulnerabilities.
5. **Server Configuration:**
   - DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment.
   - DNS server for domain name resolution.
   - Web server hosting campus resources.
6. **IoT Integration:**
   - Simulation of smart devices for campus automation and monitoring.
